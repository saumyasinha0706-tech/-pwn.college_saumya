# Challenge Name
  Multiple globs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cCQsD9hA2YWN3TiPBNIkXXq6by0.0lM3kjNxwCOwEzNzEzW}`
i had to provide a single argument that could cover every word with a p in it which meant i had to use "*".

```bash
 cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{cCQsD9hA2YWN3TiPBNIkXXq6by0.0lM3kjNxwCOwEzNzEzW}
