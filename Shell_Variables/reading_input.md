# Challenge Name
Reading input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cJZQBjdKeLJAZdPyNK2SuJJomLC.QX4cTN0wCOwEzNzEzW}`
i used the read command with the variable pwn to take input. then, i typed college and pressed enter. this assigned the value `college` to the `pwn` variable.

```bash
read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{cJZQBjdKeLJAZdPyNK2SuJJomLC.QX4cTN0wCOwEzNzEzW}
```
