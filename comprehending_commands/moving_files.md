# Challenge Name
Moving files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cagTRG134BSBLkYrwCXmBB6rvwv.0VOxEzNxwCOwEzNzEzW}`
The challenge explained that we can move files around with the mv command. Following the example given, I moved /flag to tmp/hack-the-planet.
I ran /challenge/check to obtain the flag.


```bash
 mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{cagTRG134BSBLkYrwCXmBB6rvwv.0VOxEzNxwCOwEzNzEzW}
```
## Incorrect tangents I went on
I was misguided by the ls command at first, so I thoughtI had to perform that too.

## What I learned
I learned about the mv command.
