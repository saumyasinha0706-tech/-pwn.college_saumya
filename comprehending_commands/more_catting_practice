# Challenge Name
More catting practice

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MZP3--iBFfxvjA6PUOOgB3F3I7z.QXwITO0wCOwEzNzEzW}`
The challenge stated that I had to find the flag without using cd, that is, I had to use absolute arguments. 

```bash
 cat /usr/include/gnu/flag
pwn.college{MZP3--iBFfxvjA6PUOOgB3F3I7z.QXwITO0wCOwEzNzEzW}
```
## Incorrect tangents I went on
None

## What I learned
I learned about catting with absolute arguments

## References
