# Challenge Name
Matching with *

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yo-s69oaQzm3JQLxIjB4o8Lcn2t.QXxIDO0wCOwEzNzEzW}`
I was limited to only 4 characters, so I figured /c*e ie using the c and e of challenge would work, which it did.

```bash
  cd /c*e
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Yo-s69oaQzm3JQLxIjB4o8Lcn2t.QXxIDO0wCOwEzNzEzW}
```
