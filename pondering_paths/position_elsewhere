# Challenge Name

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UDyIvFp9e4eeTd0j3GO8O8O_q9P.QX3QTN0wCOwEzNzEzW}`
I first ran /challenge/run to get the message that I was not in the correct directory. And then I changed to that.

```bash
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
