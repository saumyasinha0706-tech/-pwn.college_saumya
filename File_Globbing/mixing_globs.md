## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cESFTjhVuZaXWPPfFnweAW00pd0.QX1IDO0wCOwEzNzEzW}`
i had to find a combination that would work for  "challenging", "educational", and "pwning". so [cep]* included every word that started with c e and p.
```bash
 cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{cESFTjhVuZaXWPPfFnweAW00pd0.QX1IDO0wCOwEzNzEzW}
